# Pi Constellation

*Mathematical constants rendered as cosmic patterns*

Ten thousand decimal places of π transformed into a visual constellation, where each digit becomes a colored point of light. Adjacent identical digits connect to form intricate patterns, revealing the hidden structure within mathematical infinity. The visualization reads from top-left to bottom-right, mapping the sequence of π into geometric space where mathematical beauty becomes visible.
